    question: "What is the actual difference between Get Found, Get Called, and Own the Area?",
    answer:
      "Get Found gets your business a website and an optimized Google Business Profile so people searching nearby can find you. Get Called adds expanded local SEO and AEO (AI answer engine optimization), so you also show up when people use AI tools to find a business like yours, plus a review generation strategy. Own the Area builds on both with ongoing content, competitor tracking, and monthly reporting so you stay ahead of competitors over time, not just at launch. The monthly care plan scales with the tier too, since the amount of ongoing work scales with it.",
  },
  {
    id: "1",
    question: "What does \"AEO\" mean, and why does it matter for a local business?",
    answer:
      "AEO stands for AI answer engine optimization. When someone asks an AI tool like ChatGPT or Google's AI Overviews to recommend a business near them, AEO is what makes sure your business shows up in that answer with the right hours, service area, and phone number. More customers are starting their search in an AI chat instead of typing into Google, and a site that is not set up correctly simply will not get mentioned.",
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    question: "What is the 2-week guarantee?",
    answer:
      "If your site and Google Business Profile are not live within 2 weeks of you providing the content we ask for (your business info, photos, and any text you want included), you get a free month of monitoring. The clock starts once we have what we need from you, so the fastest way to launch fast is to send your content right away.",
  },
  {
    id: "3",
    question: "How much does this cost?",
    answer:
      "Get Found runs $1,200 to $1,800 up front plus $150 a month, Get Called runs $2,200 to $3,500 up front plus $275 a month, and Own the Area runs $3,500 to $5,500 up front plus $450 to $500 a month. The monthly care plan scales with the tier since the amount of ongoing work scales with it. Exact pricing depends on your business and what you need built. Book a free 30-minute consultation and you will get a clear, written quote before committing to anything.",
  },
  {
    id: "4",
    question: "I already have a website. Do I need a new one, or can you just fix my SEO?",
    answer:
      "It depends on what is underneath your current site. Some sites just need the SEO and Google Business Profile work, others are built in a way that makes good SEO impossible without a rebuild. On the consultation call, we will look at your current site and tell you honestly which is the case before recommending anything.",
  },
  {
    id: "5",
    question: "What kind of businesses do you work with?",
    answer:
      "Local, service-based businesses, plumbers, HVAC, auto repair, towing, salons, and similar trades that depend on people nearby finding them and calling. If you rely on local search and phone calls to bring in customers, this is built for you.",
  },
  {
    id: "6",
    question: "How long does it take from start to launch?",
    answer:
      "Most sites are live within 2 weeks of us receiving your content, that is the guarantee. The timeline depends on how quickly you can send your business details, photos, and any text you want on the site. The faster you provide that, the faster you are live.",
  },
  {
    id: "7",
    question: "What happens after my site launches? Is there ongoing cost?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Every tier includes a monthly care plan that covers hosting, monitoring, and keeping your Google Business Profile and SEO work current, starting at $150 a month for Get Found and scaling up to $450 to $500 a month for Own the Area. The fee scales with the tier because the amount of ongoing work does too, Own the Area includes ongoing content and competitor tracking, for example. There are no surprise add-on fees.",
  },
  {
    id: "8",
    question: "Do you offer anything besides websites and SEO?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We help with lead routing automation, CRM setup, Microsoft 365, and staff training for anyone who needs it, not just website clients. That said, if you do not have leads coming in yet, we will usually recommend starting with your site and local search, since automation only pays off once you have inquiries to manage.",
  },
  {
    id: "9",
    question: "How do I get started?",
    answer:
      "Book a free 30-minute consultation. We will look at where your business currently shows up, or does not, in local search, recommend which tier fits, and give you a clear, written quote. No pressure to move forward.",
