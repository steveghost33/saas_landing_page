              Ella Tech Solutions was founded after approximately 15 years of working as an IT leader and program director inside nonprofits and large organizations across Michigan. That experience includes hands-on CRM implementations, learning platform builds, Microsoft 365 environments, and staff training inside organizations where budgets are limited and technology decisions have real operational consequences.
            </p>
            <p className="body-1 text-p5 mb-5">
              The firm operates as a fractional CTO and strategic technology partner, providing senior-level technology strategy directly to each client. That means you get experienced leadership on your actual technology decisions — without the cost of a full-time hire.
