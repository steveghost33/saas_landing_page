              Nonprofits don't have a technology shortage — they have an implementation problem. Staff are busy, budgets are tight, and most vendors sell software without providing the training or configuration it takes to get it used. We do both. Every engagement includes full setup and hands-on training, so the tools we implement actually become part of how your organization works.
