                Most CRM implementations take 6 to 12 weeks from contract to staff training completion. The timeline depends on the volume and complexity of existing data, the number of staff members to be trained, and how many custom workflows need to be configured. Implementations with clean, well-organized existing data and a small team run closer to 6 weeks. Implementations involving large datasets, duplicate cleanup, or complex reporting requirements run closer to 12 weeks.
