              <p className="body-1 text-p5">
                LMS platform selection and setup typically takes 3 to 4 weeks. Course content development in Articulate 360 runs 2 to 4 weeks per module depending on the length, interactivity level, and amount of subject matter review required. Organizations developing multiple courses can stagger production to maintain a faster overall delivery schedule.
