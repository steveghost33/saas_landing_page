We stay involved because the technology side, tracking outcomes, pulling reports, documenting impact, is usually where organizations and businesses struggle most.

          <div className="container mb-16 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
            <div className="rounded-2xl bg-s3/10 border border-s3/20 p-8">
              <p className="caption text-p3 mb-3 uppercase tracking-wide">Why we do this alongside CRM and data work</p>
              <p className="body-1 text-p5">
                Most grant writers hand you a submitted proposal and disappear. We've spent 15 years building the CRM and reporting systems nonprofits and small businesses use to track donors, customers, programs, and outcomes, so when a grant gets awarded, we already know how to set up the tracking a funder expects. The writing gets you the grant. The systems keep you in compliance and in a strong position for the next one.

          {/* Engagement Length */}

              <h2 className="h3 text-p4 mb-4">Typical engagement length</h2>
              <p className="body-1 text-p5">
                A single proposal typically takes 2 to 4 weeks depending on the funder's deadline and how much program data is already documented. Grant readiness reviews run 1 to 2 weeks and produce a written checklist of what to fix before applying. Ongoing grant research and writing support is available on a retainer basis for organizations applying to multiple funders throughout the year.
