                Single-tool workshops run 1 week of preparation time plus the delivery day. Larger programs that include custom content development, multiple tools, or both live and self-paced formats run 4 to 8 weeks from the initial needs assessment through final delivery. Timeline depends on the number of tools covered, the number of staff, and whether video content needs to be produced.
