                Most website projects run 4 to 8 weeks from kickoff to launch, depending on the number of pages, the complexity of integrations, and how quickly the client can provide content, feedback, and approvals. Projects with a clear content plan and timely review cycles typically complete closer to the 4-week end of that range. Projects with more pages or custom functionality run closer to 8 weeks.
